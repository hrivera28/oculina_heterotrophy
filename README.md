## Oculina arbuscula heterotrophy and heat stress experiment
This repo contains the data and scripts associated with the manuscript:
Rivera, H.E., ..., Davies, S.W. (in review) Heat challenge elicits stronger physiological and gene expression responses than starvation in symbiotic <i>Oculina arbuscula</i>

### Organization
The repository is separated into input files, scripts, figures, and tables folders.

The read_mapping_count_scripts folder contains all scripts that were used to:
1. Quality filter and trim raw TagSeq RNA reads
2. Map reads to the reference <i>O. arbuscula</i> and <i>B. psygmophilum</i> transcriptomes (see https://github.com/hrivera28/oculina_apo-sym_gene_expression)
3. Count number of mapped reads for differential gene expression analyses

All other analyses used for the publication are in the Master_analyses_final.R script

All the input data that would be needed to run analyses is included in the input_files.Final figures and tables that are in the manuscript and supplementary data are included in the respective figures and tables folders for easy reference.
